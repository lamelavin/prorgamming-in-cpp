    ******************* Inheritance in C++ ******************

    1. Reusablity is a very important feature of OOPs
    2. In C++ we can use a class and add additional features to it 
    3. Reusing classes saves time and money
    4. Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again.

    *************** What is Inheritance in C++ *****************
    
    1. The concept of reusablity in C++ is supported using inheritance
    2. We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it
    3. The existing class is called Base Class
    4. The new class which is inherited is called as the Derived Class
    5. Reusing classes saves time and money
    6. There are different types of inheritance in C++

    ***************** Forms of Inheritance in C++ ******************

    1. Multiple Inheritance : A derived class with more than one Base class
    2. Hierarchical Inheritance : Several derived classes from a single base class
    3. Multilevel Inheritance : Deriving a class from already derived class
    4. Hybrid Inheritance :

        4.1 : Hybrid inheritance is a combinatino of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.
        4.2 : A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance
        4.3 : However one of the parent classes is not a base class

    5. Single Inheritance in C++ : A derived class with only one Base Class
