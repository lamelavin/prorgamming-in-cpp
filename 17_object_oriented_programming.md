# ********************* Object Oriented Programming ****************

/*

    1. Works on the concept of classes and objects

    2. A class is a template to create a object

    3. Treats data as a critical element

    4. Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects

*/

# ******************* Basic Concepts in OOPs ********************

/*

    1. Classes - Basic template for creating object

    2. Objects - Basic run time entities

    3. Data Abstraction & Encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into single unit

    4. Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited into others

    5. Polymorphism - Ability to take more than one forms

    6. Dynamic Binding - Code which will execute is not known unit the program runs
    
    7. Message Passing - Object.message(Information) call format

*/

# ********************** Why OOPs ***********************

/*

    1. C++ lang was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features to C lang
    
    2. As the size of program increases, readablity, maintainability, and bug free nature of program decreases

    3. This was the major problem with lang like C which relied upon functions and procedures (hence the name procedural programming lang)

    4. As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high

    5. Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was compromised

    6. Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario

*/


# ****************** Advantages of OOPs *********************

/*

    1. Better code reusability using objects and inheritance

    2. Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems

    3. Multiple objects can co-exists without any interference

    4. Software complexity can be easily managed

*/


# ***************** Procedure Oriented Programming ***********************

/*

    1. Consists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow

    2. Main focus is on functions and not on flow of data

    3. Functions can either use global or local data

    4. Data moves openly from function to function
